      <h1>What is Drag the Dots?</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>A simple mobile game</li>
        <li>built with phonegap</li>
        <li>released in iOS and google play stores</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h1>How was it made? (technical)</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Phonegap</li>
        <li>Single Page App</li>
        <li>jQuery Draggable/trig</li>
        <li>coffeescript</li>
        <li>event driven</li>
        <li>JSONP</li>
        <li>local storage</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Phonegap</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Phonegap is a native wrapper around html/css/js</li>
        <li>Everything is in a webview with a few apis</li>
        <li>Cross platform: iOS/Android/windows phone/blackberry etc</li>
        <li>Easy to write if you knwo html css/js</li>
        <li>lacks native ui/performance</li>
        <li>ideal for go it alone projects</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Single Page App</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>All the markup is in one page</li>
        <li>Use JS to show and hide divs as screens</li>
        <li>JS variables are persisted due to lack of page reloads</li>
        <li>consistent styling/state</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>jQuery Draggable/trig</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Simple core game mechanic</li>
        <li>stated off by just dragging divs around</li>
        <li>assigned each div a target to 'hit'</li>
        <li>simple maths using x/y/radius to determine if they collide</li>
        <li>on collision trigger the next state</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>coffeescript</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>coffeescript is a language that compiles to javascript</li>
        <li>Each piece of divisible functionality is seperated into a coffeescript class</li>
        <li>This structure has made it easier to add new functionality and improve areas</li>
        <li>An example of this is an experimental branch with multi touch instead of jquery ui draggable.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Event Driven</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>to keep concerns seperated alot of activity was bound to events</li>
        <li>These events allowed layouts gameplay ui screens and timers to be seperate</li>
        <li>events made it easy to hook in analytics and storage of interaction data</li>
        <li>events made for easy debugging, findt he event that isnt firing there's your bug!</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>JSONP</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>All of the communication with the server makes use of JSONP</li>
        <li>JSONP is a method by which you can aysnchronously communicate iwt ha server that is not your own.</li>
        <li>becuase phonegap games are not served in a traditional sense there is no chance for CORS or similar</li>
        <li>Ideally in time I will replace these jsonP calls with built in game services from apple/google.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>local storage</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>In order to persist data in phonegame you have ot use the localstorage api</li>
        <li>it is a sim[ple key/value pairing via a few simple commands</li>
        <li>The local high scores and preferences are stored in local storage</li>
        <li>Local storage can theoretically be lost at any point so you can't rely upon it</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h1>How was it made? (theoretical)</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>simple mechanic</li>
        <li>multiple levels</li>
        <li>persisting user data</li>
        <li>compulsion</li>
        <li>competition</li>
        <li>updates</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>simple mechanic</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>People like dragging things</li>
        <li>Typically a isngle game lasts under 30 seconds</li>
        <li>The gamei s always the same, drag the dots</li>
        <li>By varying the configuration/environments the game has some variety</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>multiple levels</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>More levels allow different users to have preferences</li>
        <li>by adding levels there is an obvious way to extend interest in the game and provide further value</li>
        <li>Existing levels can be modified by changing colourschemes/designs</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>persisting user data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>By keeping a local highscore the user is reminded how they are doin gand how far they have come</li>
        <li>data such as hits/misses/time spent are being recorded</li>
        <li>In time achievements will be unlockable for all kinds of interactions improiving engagement.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>compulsion</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>After each game you get presented with a score and a chance to play again.</li>
        <li>Typically the user iwll know they can od better and will be driven to again</li>
        <li>the idea of just one more go is a powerful one</li>
        <li>by playing the game repeatedly it becomes a thing to do in the player's mind and they might well be hooked!</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>competition</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The Introduction of a leadboard was devisive</li>
        <li>it encouraged some to aspire to rank highly in the leaderboards</li>
        <li>others were actively put off because 'I could never get that score'</li>
        <li>The introduction of a weekly scoreboard to democratise the process backfired</li>
        <li>Engagement has dropped over time</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>updates</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Writing and maintaining updates is a huge part of games now</li>
        <li>releasing early and often is a powerful tool to
         react and provide a better experience</li>
        <li>by slowing/stopping releases over christmas I may have shot myself in the foot</li>
        <li>Many games are sustained and refreshedb y new releases</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>more releases</li>
        <li>multiplayer locally (ipad),</li>
        <li>more levels, new ui.</li>

        <li>colour themes</li>
        <li>sponsorship/partnering.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>more releases</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>getting back up to speed and a better pattern for releases is good</li>
        <li>idelaly eveyr two weeks or so release new functionality</li>
        <li>bundling releases too close is annoying for the user and exhausting for the developer</li>
        <li>regular releases brings order.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>multiplayer locally (ipad),</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I want to engage more with tablet users</li>
        <li>local multiplayer is lacking these days</li>
        <li>game could be pushed in new directions</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>more levels, new ui.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I have a new UI that i'm working on.</li>
        <li>as well as new levels</li>
        <li>making better use of screen real estate will improve the overall user experience</li>
        <li>more levels with better structure will help to give the game direction</li>
        <li>unlocking a level provides an alternative personal achievement to beating your own score.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>hopefully other developers/designers.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>its tough to have the discipline to keep going with one dev</li>
        <li>More developers/designers will bring new ideas</li>
        <li>working as a team gives you more than just manpower</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>better code formatting.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I think my code could be more modular and extensible</li>
        <li>I'd like to take some drag the dots code onto new projects without it affecting gameplay (screens etc)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>colour themes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>pretty colours!</li>
        <li>my colourschemes are pretty arbitrary</li>
        <li>contributed/branded colourschemes can help promote worthy projects</li>
        <li>more choice for a user is often a good thing</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>sponsorship/partnering.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>again more heads are better than one</li>
        <li>If i could monetize the game i could justify devoting more time to improving it</li>
        <li>I'm reluctant to 'sell out' but it'd help the development no end!</li>
      </ul>
