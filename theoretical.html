    <section>
      <h2>Simple mechanic</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>People like dragging things</li>
        <li>Typically a single game lasts under 30 seconds</li>
        <li>The game is always the same, Drag the Dots</li>
        <li>By varying the configuration/environments the game has some variety</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Multiple levels</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>More levels allow different users to have preferences</li>
        <li>By adding levels there is an obvious way to extend interest in the game and provide further value</li>
        <li>Existing levels can be modified by changing colourschemes/designs</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Persisting user data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>By keeping a local highscore the user is reminded how they are doing and how far they have come</li>
        <li>Data such as hits/misses/time spent are being recorded</li>
        <li>In time achievements will be unlockable for all kinds of interactions improving engagement</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Compulsion</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>After each game you get presented with a score and a chance to play again</li>
        <li>Typically the user will know they can do better and will be driven to again</li>
        <li>The idea of just one more go is a powerful one</li>
        <li>By playing the game repeatedly it becomes a thing to do in the player's mind and they might well be hooked!</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Competition</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The introduction of a leaderboard was devisive</li>
        <li>It encouraged some to aspire to rank highly in the leaderboards</li>
        <li>Others were actively put off because 'I could never get that score'</li>
        <li>The introduction of a weekly scoreboard to democratise the process backfired</li>
        <li>Engagement has dropped over time</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Updates</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Writing and maintaining updates is a huge part of games now</li>
        <li>Releasing early and often is a powerful tool to react and provide a better experience</li>
        <li>By slowing/stopping releases over Christmas I may have shot myself in the foot</li>
        <li>Many games are sustained and refreshed by new releases</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Which platforms?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Android - quick release cycle</li>
        <li>iOS - large (wealthy) user base</li>
        <li>Windows phone - niche market/Windows development</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Pricing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>FREE!</li>
        <li>I chose free because I wasn't sure of the product and the value it would provide</li>
        <li>As the first app I released I wanted low barrier to entry for new users</li>
        <li>Next app will have a longer dev cycle and be 69p</li>
        <li>Tax issues and international release issues for paid apps</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What next?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>More releases</li>
        <li>More levels, new ui</li>
        <li>Hopefully other developers/designers</li>
        <li>Sponsorship/partnering</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>More releases</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Getting back up to speed and a better pattern for releases is good</li>
        <li>Ideally every two weeks or so release new functionality</li>
        <li>Bundling releases too close is annoying for the user and exhausting for the developer</li>
        <li>Regular releases brings order</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>More levels, new ui</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I have a new UI that I'm working on.</li>
        <li>As well as new levels</li>
        <li>Making better use of screen real estate will improve the overall user experience</li>
        <li>More levels with better structure will help to give the game direction</li>
        <li>Unlocking a level provides an alternative personal achievement to beating your own score</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Hopefully other developers/designers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>It's tough to have the discipline to keep going with one dev</li>
        <li>My design skills are limited</li>
        <li>More developers/designers will bring new ideas</li>
        <li>Working as a team gives you more than just man power</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Sponsorship/partnering.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Again more heads are better than one</li>
        <li>If I could monetise the game I could justify devoting more time to improving it</li>
        <li>I'm reluctant to 'sell out' but it'd help the development no end!</li>
      </ul>
