    <section>
      <h2>simple mechanic</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>People like dragging things</li>
        <li>Typically a single game lasts under 30 seconds</li>
        <li>The game is always the same, drag the dots</li>
        <li>By varying the configuration/ environments the game has some variety</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>multiple levels</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>More levels allow different users to have preferences</li>
        <li>by adding levels there is an obvious way to extend interest in the game and provide further value</li>
        <li>Existing levels can be modified by changing colourschemes/ designs</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>persisting user data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>By keeping a local highscore the user is reminded how they are doing and how far they have come</li>
        <li>data such as hits/misses/time spent are being recorded</li>
        <li>In time achievements will be unlockable for all kinds of interactions improving engagement.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>compulsion</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>After each game you get presented with a score and a chance to play again.</li>
        <li>Typically the user will know they can do better and will be driven to again</li>
        <li>the idea of just one more go is a powerful one</li>
        <li>by playing the game repeatedly it becomes a thing to do in the player's mind and they might well be hooked!</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>competition</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The Introduction of a leaderboard was devisive</li>
        <li>it encouraged some to aspire to rank highly in the leaderboards</li>
        <li>others were actively put off because 'I could never get that score'</li>
        <li>The introduction of a weekly scoreboard to democratise the process backfired</li>
        <li>Engagement has dropped over time</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <!-- show leaderboards -->
    <section>
      <h2>updates</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Writing and maintaining updates is a huge part of games now</li>
        <li>releasing early and often is a powerful tool to
         react and provide a better experience</li>
        <li>by slowing/stopping releases over christmas I may have shot myself in the foot</li>
        <li>Many games are sustained and refreshed by new releases</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>

    <section>
      <h2>which platforms?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Android - quick release cycle</li>
        <li>iOS - large (wealthy) user base</li>
        <li>windows phone - niche market/windows development</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>pricing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>FREE!</li>
        <li>I chose free because i wasn't sure of the product and the value it would provide.</li>
        <li>as a first app released i wanted low barrier to entry for new users</li>
        <li>next app will have a longer dev cycle and be 69p</li>
        <li>tax issues and international release issues for paid apps</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>What next?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>more releases</li>
        <li>more levels, new ui.</li>
        <li>hopefully other developers/designers.</li>
        <li>sponsorship/partnering.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>more releases</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>getting back up to speed and a better pattern for releases is good</li>
        <li>ideally every two weeks or so release new functionality</li>
        <li>bundling releases too close is annoying for the user and exhausting for the developer</li>
        <li>regular releases brings order.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>more levels, new ui.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I have a new UI that I'm working on.</li>
        <li>As well as new levels</li>
        <li>Making better use of screen real estate will improve the overall user experience</li>
        <li>More levels with better structure will help to give the game direction</li>
        <li>Unlocking a level provides an alternative personal achievement to beating your own score.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>hopefully other developers/designers.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>It's tough to have the discipline to keep going with one dev.</li>
        <li>My design skills are limited.</li>
        <li>More developers/designers will bring new ideas</li>
        <li>working as a team gives you more than just manpower</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>sponsorship/partnering.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Again more heads are better than one</li>
        <li>If I could monetize the game I could justify devoting more time to improving it.</li>
        <li>I'm reluctant to 'sell out' but it'd help the development no end!</li>
      </ul>
